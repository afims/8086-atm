Project no.: P1
Question:

Design a processo-based online system for Data logging which stores the following parameters:




Parameter:               Range:

DC Voltage     :        0-10 V

Temperature    :        200-800 C

Pressure         :        2-10 Pa

Data logging should be done every 10 minutes for a period and should be user programmable. 
Facility for displaying the average values every six hours, for parameters read during the data logging period should also be included.
